#  Final Project: Game of Life
# ========================================================================================

#  The Game of Life is a simplified model of evolution and natural selection
#  invented by the mathematician James Conway.

#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Rules

#  You have a grid of cells in 2 dimensions.

#  Each cell has 8 neighbors:
#  - top, right, bottom, left
#  - top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left

#  Each cell has 2 possible states: alive or dead.

#  if a cell is alive and
#  - has fewer than 2 live neighbors, it dies 
#  - has more than 3 live neighbors, it dies
#  - has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it lives to next generation

#  if cell is dead and
#  - has exactly 3 live neighbors, it becomes a live cell

#  edges of board:
#  - pretend the board is folded onto itself
#  - the edges touch each other


#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Tests

#  You must have MiniTest unit tests for your class to validate your implementation.
#  You might need to add methods or change the method signatures to enable testing.


#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Rendering

#  You choose how you want to render the current state of the board.
#  ASCII? HTML? Something else?


#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Bonus: DSL

#  - Create a DSL that represents a state of the game.
#  - Your render method can then be formatted as the DSL, so that you can round-trip
#    between the textual DSL representation and the running instance.

#  Suggested Implementation

module FinalProject
  class GameOfLife
    def initialize(size)
      # randomly initialize the board
    end
    def evolve
      # apply rules to each cell and generate new state
    end
    def render
      # render the current state of the board
    end
    def run(num_generations)
      # evolve and render for num_generations
    end
  end
end
