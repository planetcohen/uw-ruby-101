# Sinatra Intro

## Ovreview

In class, we created a simple Sinatra app that works with articles.

We created a model, which is implemented in `article.rb`.

We created a controller, which is in `articles_controller.rb`.
The controller has 2 sets of routes: one set for the html UI,
and another set for the JSON api.

We also created views for the html UI, in the views folder.

## Getting Started

See http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html.

Install the gem:

```bash
gem install sinatra
```

Run the app:

```bash
ruby articles_controller.rb
```

View the app in your browser here:
`http://localhost:4567/articles`
